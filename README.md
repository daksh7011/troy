## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

Troy is built with modern Kotlin practices and follows a structured architecture:

### üíª Technology Stack

- **Kotlin**: Primary programming language
- **Kord**: Discord API wrapper for Kotlin
- **KordEx**: Extension framework for Kord that provides command handling
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing configuration and moderation data
- **Koin**: Dependency injection framework
- **Sentry**: Optional error tracking and monitoring

### üìÇ Project Structure

- **commands/**: Contains all bot commands organized by category
    - **config/**: Configuration-related commands
    - **funstuff/**: Entertainment and fun commands
    - **misc/**: Miscellaneous utility commands
    - **mod/**: Moderation commands
    - **nsfw/**: Age-restricted commands
- **core/**: Core bot functionality and initialization
- **data/**: Data models and repositories
- **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers
- **apiModels/**: Data models for external API integrations

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Features Implementation

- **Phishing Protection**: Automatically scans messages for known phishing domains and warns users
- **Moderation System**: Tracks warnings, kicks, and bans in the database for accountability
- **Command Framework**: Uses KordEx for slash command support with permission handling
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses Koin for managing dependencies and services

### üß© Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Used for data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection**: For loose coupling between components
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Responds to Discord events through event handlers
